			<p>Emacs's bytecode is pretty old &mdash; as old as Emacs itself. And
				although there have been some changes to it, there has always been lurking
				in the background the question of whether it might be totally ditched,
				either as a by-product of switching out the underlying Lisp
				implementation for something else, or as a result of using JIT
				technology. <b>[next]</b>
			</p>

			<p>Let's take these two situations where Emacs Lisp Bytecode might become
				obsolete separately. Both ideas have been floating around for a
				long time.
			</p>

			<p>With respect to alternate programming-language implementations, there
				have been many languages that been proposed and experimented with. The
				big obstacle in totally replacing Emacs Lisp is in rewriting the huge
				current Emacs Lisp code base. I think that if such an approach were to
				work, the language would have to be available as an additional
				language until the current code base was replaced. Currently
				alternate programming languages haven't gained much of
				a foothold; they are not in the Emacs distribution or in any
				of its branches.</p>

			<p>An obvious alternative language proposed is Common Lisp. Over
				time, an Emacs Lisp package implementation Common Lisp has been
				providing more and more Common Lisp functionality. The
				addition of features in Common Lisp has been somewhat
				reflected in changes in the run-time systems, such as the
				addition of lexical scoping. And this approach partially
				solves the large code-base migration problem. But it also
				reduces the need to jump cold turkey from Emacs Lisp Bytecode
				to something else.<b>[next]</b>
				</p>

			<p>And what about the other possibility where Emacs incorporates JIT
				technology? The motivation for this is to speed up Emacs. There is
				widespread belief among the development community that there could be
				big performance wins if this were done right. After all, it is not
				uncommon for some people to live inside a single GNU Emacs session.
				</p>

			<p>This idea of using a JIT to speed performance goes back over a decade,
				at least back to 2006. Of the JITs that have been proposed, at least
				four of them use Emacs Lisp Bytecode as the basis from which to JIT
				from. I think that is because Emacs Lisp Bytecode is a reasonable
				target to JIT: it is sufficiently low level, while also easy to hook a
				JIT into.</p>

			<p>Two alternatives to Emacs Lisp Bytecode which have sophisticated JIT
				technology are LLVM IR and JVM IR. For each, the surrounding run-time
				environment would have to be replicated. Another IR possibility might
				be JavaScript IRs: specifically, the ones for V8 and Spidermonkey.</p>

			<p>I have long been interested in beefing up run-time environment in Programming Languages

			<p>I added the ability to debug in Bash (around 2.05b), and GNU Make. In

			<p>Recently I have been interested in decompilation as a way of getting

		<h3>A Tale of Two Interpreters part 2: Bytecode</h3>
		<aside class="notes">
			<p>You can turn any lisp function into bytecode by
					calling <code>byte-compile</code>. It returns a bytecode object
					which is a special kind of Lisp vector. What each of the
					parts in the vector is described in the Elisp bytecode
					manual. I won't go into any detail into that, except to say
					that you can isolate each of the parts
					using <code>aref</code> and that the 3rd item is a bytecode
					string which is an encoding of a LAP or (Lisp Assembly
				Program.</p>


			<p>Note
			that <code>functionp</code>, <code>symbol-function</code> (not
			shown here), and <code>funcall</code> work as they do for Lisp
				interpreter functions. Under the covers <code>funcall</code>,
				is using <code>symbol-function</code> to extract the definition
				of the function in order to figure out how to evaluate it.
				<b>[next]</b></p>

			<p>Since the bytecode string is abstruse, you can use the
				<code>disassemble</code> function to produce a more human
				readable version. Of course, there is question as to whether
				you really <i>want</i> to understand yet another language. I don't
				and I'm going to talk about eliminating or reducing that step.
			</p>

			<p>Ok, with allof this a background we can start to see what and
				understand what's going on when we hit an error.  Let's look
				at some errors reported by Emacs. First, Emacs Lisp.

		<aside class="notes">
			<p>Note that we get the text fragment from were it comes
				from. Oddly it is shown as the more conventional function form
				with the parameters but not the function name in
				parenthesis. So we see <code>/(1 0)</code>.</p>

				But it is a little weird for another reason. Look at
				the <code>cond</code> on the next line. It is supposed to be
				the surrounding context. It is a bit too broad. More specific
				would be that we are in the first <i>clause</i> of the
				cond.</p>

			<p>The line below that now gives the function called with the
				parameter value: <code>fib-bug(1)</code>. In Emacs there is
				also a link which you can click on that will get you to the
				source of that function if available.  To do this though there
				is some serious magic getting used which is the same magic
				used by the <code>(describe-function)</code> function. The
				underlying hacky function that gets called is
			<code>find-lisp-object-file-name</code>.</p>

			<p>After the <code>fib-bug</code> call, we now have another
				context line. And as before it is a bit too broad, and we
				begin to the pattern.  Thespecific call location is not shown
				but its parent. Here, we are unluckly because it is ambiguous.
				This is frustrating me because the interpreter has the
				ability to distinguish.</p>

			<p>If you find this as I do a little lacking, compare what you get when bytecode
				is run...</p>

			<p>I didn't reveal this before, but <code>symbol-function</code>
				can actually return some other funky things. The reason for
				this set of slides is to show you that Emacs currently has a
				lot of flexibility right now in deciding how to execute a
				function.  And therefore lends itself to <i>extension</i>. (I
				bet you knew that already).</p>

				<p>Try this for on <code>insert-file</code> and notice the
				document field is a location inside a file. <b>[next]</b>
				</p>
			<p>It is not really <code>symbol-function</code> that is being
				funky, what can be stored as a symbols "function" property.
				And when that is a byte-code object, there can be variation in
				what gets stored in the bytecode fields.</p>

			<p>So here is another variation you can have in a bytecode
				object. Sometimes there can be <i>two</i> pointers to file
				locations: one for the docstring, and another one for the
				byte string. The reason we didn't see this before in
				"insert-file" is because insert-file was already loaded in
				emacs. When emacs starts up, it already has the bytecode for
				"insert-file" so it doeesn't need to retrieve it again. The
				same thing is true for the doc string. Once it gets loaded,
				that file pointer will disasppear. <b>[next]</b>.
			</p>

			<p>Another thing that can stored as the function property and
			reported by <code>symbol-function</code> are autoloaded
			functions. <b>[next]</b></p>

			<p>Finally, <code>symbol-function</code> can report that the
				function is some C code. In the Emacs written in Rust project,
				it can also be Rust source code.</p>

		<h4>Tracking Bytecode offsets</h4>
		<video controls width="600">
			<source src="video/divide.webm" type="video/webm" />
			<aside class="notes">
				<p>Currently, there is no support inside Emacs Lisp for
					getting information about the current bytecode
					offset. Internally, a local C pointer is used which means
					inside the tight bytecode evaluator it is generally only
					available as a register.</p>

				<p>So I modified Emacs to add a Emacs Lisp variable to save
					the last offset run. I also save the bytecode offset every
					time an error is caught; technically: every time a signal is
					raised.</p>

				<p>Currently I did this inside the interpreter loop only on
					divide operations; it is trivial to move this code right
					after the instruction fetch thereby to save it executing any
					bytecode. The reason I've limited this is to make
					demonstrating the concept simpler. Since bytecode is
					pervasively used, such as in a signal-handler hook functions
					and in the debugger read loop, were I to do it on all
					instructions the interesting value at the point of error
					would have been long gone. Conceptually what I need to do on
					raising a signal is to create some sort of notion of a stack
					frame where I can squirrel the offset value.</p>

			<h3>Parse to Text</h3>
			<aside class="notes">
				<p>Here we'll show how to reconstruct the source text from
					this tree.</p>

				<p>Bytecode instructions are the leaves of the tree, and none of the
					instructions are missing. So in that sense this is not the same as an
					"abstract syntax tree" in a compiler. Nothing abstract about it.
					It is more like a grammar parse you might see in linguistics imposed on top of
					an English sentence.</p>

				<p>Some of the instruction like "VARREF" have an operand while
					others like "QUO" does not.</p>

				<p>I'm sorry that the instructions are not in a nice linear
					sequence as they were shown previously. However as we will
					see, the fact that the instructions like "QUO" are at
					different levels of the tree has a big impact on describing
					where you are in your program. Even though these two
					instructions follow one another.</p>


				<p>One other thing to note here is that there only three
						different node internal types: "expr", "binary_op", and "binary_expr".</p>

				<p>From the offset we can find a position in this tree. The

					something like this could be adapted for Emacs. <b>down</b></p>

		<h4>Adding Locations to Bytecode</h4>
			<aside class="notes"><p>This stuff is pretty complicated. You may say, Rocky is this how things are
					normally done? Isn't there are simpler way?</p>

				<p>Well, yes. But it involves changing the code to emit
				bytecode and the bytecode optiizer.</p>

				<p>Recall in both kinds of compilers we have a parse tree. In byte
					compiling you have accurate information about which constructs were used
					and the position in source text that they are located. What you'd have to do
					is save those somewhere as you are parsing. That's not currently done.
					And then typically along with the bytecode you'd have to store this somewhere.
					The most logical place would be to extend the bytecode object to have what is
					somewhat narrow-mindedly called a "line number table". Really it is a mapping of
					positions from the source text to the object code.</p>

				<p>I suppose you could also save this in the bytecode file somewhere as a constant giving
					it a name that is related to the function name.</p>

				<p>In our example we would have:</p>

				<p>A downside with this "eager" approach is that you have to do all the work up front first.
					I imagine getting this blessed by the Emacs devel community and signed off on enough to
					change Emacs would be a lot of work.</p>


				<p>In contrast, in the decompiler, there is that one little change to track offsets, and the
					the rest can be done independent of Emacs core development. The two approaches are not
					mutually exclusive. And I do agree that it would be nice to have a traditional line
					number table like this.

		<h4>Suggested Projects</h4>
		<aside class="notes"><p>That's roughly all I have to say, but as you can see there is
				still much to do. There were a few <i>reasons</i> to give the talk. At the outset,
				I had a problem I feel needs solving. I hope I have convinced you that it might be
				worthwhile and that you too might help. In doing that, I learned a lot about bytecode
				and it is neat. It is probably not going away. And it is probably not going to get
				improved unless people help out.</p>

		<h3>Links...</h3>
		<aside class="notes">
			<p>The first link is the github project that does Emacs Lisp decompilation.
				However a lot of that code is written in Python.</p>

			<p>The second link is the github project code for an Jay Earley parser written in Emacs Lisp.
				I ported it from a Common Lisp program.</p>

			<p>The third link is a pretty extensive Emacs Lisp Bytecode manual. I got a lot of help from
				pipcet, and we copied material from a blog post of Chris Wellon. Also some material was
				copied from the Emacs Lisp manual. Stephan Monier gave suggestions too.</p>

			<p>If you are interested in learning more about the decompilation process used in this
				decompiler and the one for Python, the research paper given next has a bit of detail.
			</p>

			<p>Thanks.</p>
