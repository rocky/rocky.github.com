		<h3>Where am I now &mdash; Really?</h3>

		<aside class="notes">
			<p>Hi I am rocky bernstein.</p>
			<p>This talk is in two parts. The first part describes
				decompilation; and then the second part to demoes it from a
				debugger.</p>

			<p>I make a lot of mistakes, and always have. I even make mistakes in
				finding my mistakes.</p>

			<p>So when I do, I'd like to know exactly where I am at. Computers
				generally excel at giving detailed information involving lots of
				calculation. But in this one area, just about all of the programming
				languages could do better at giving more precise and useful
				information. Let's look at a Python error...
			</p>
		</aside>

	<section>
		<h3>A Python Error</h3>

		<p><pre><code class="python">
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "bug.py", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
    i / j / k
ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
		</code></pre></p>

		<p class="fragment roll-in">Was <code>j</code> zero, or
			was <code>k</code> zero?</p>

		<aside class="notes">
			<p>The message gives the file name "bug.py" and the line number of
				the error, line two. It even gives the text of line two. This is
				great!  But there are <i>two</i> divisions on line two.</p>

			<p><b>[next]</b> Which one are we talking about?
  			Was <code>j</code> zero, or was <code>k</code> zero?</p>

			<p>Here, are some other examples...</p>
		</aside>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>More errors where line numbers are not good enough</h3>

		<pre><code class="python">
x = prev[prev[0]]                      # which prev ?
		</code></pre>
		<pre class="fragment roll-in"><code class="python">
[e[0] for i in d[j] if got[i] == e[i]] # lots going on here
		</code></pre>
		<pre class="fragment roll-in"><code class="python">
exec(some_code % 10, namespace)        # code created at runtime
		</code></pre>

		<aside class="notes">
			<p>If I get an error in subscripting "prev", which "prev" access
			are we talking about?</p>

			<p><b>[next]</b> In the second example there are several different array
				accesses, and even if you know which say that the value of the
				index is of 0, you still wouldn't know which list was being
				accessed.  I will show how we can disambiguate these.</p>

			<p><b>[next]</b> The last example I think is particularly interesting, because
				it shows that in Python you can run code that is created at
				runtime and the source code doesn't sit in a file somewhere.</p>

			<p>Here is an	error message you can get from running that...</p>
		</aside>

	<section>
		<h3>An Error where no file exists</h3>

		<pre><code class="python">
exec(some_code)
		</code></pre>

		<pre><code>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "bug-exec.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
    exec(template % 10, namespace)
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &ltmodule&gt;
NameError: name 'bad' is not defined
		</code></pre>

		<p>File <code>"&lt;string&gt;"</code>?</p>

		<aside class="notes">
			<p>Woah! File <code>"&lt;string&gt;"</code>? And where in the word
				is "bad" located in that?  In Python you can run code that is
				created at runtime and the source code doesn't sit in a file
				somewhere.</p>

			<p>Let's see how we do better. But to show how, we need to take a
				little detour to understand how the computer "sees" the program
				compared to how we see it.... <b>next</b></p>

		<h3>Programmer vs. Computer</h3>

		<p>A programmer may write:
			<pre><code class="python">
  x + y
		</code></pre></p>

		<aside class="notes">
			<p>In the C Python implementation, the code you write gets
				translated into something called Bytecode. when I write in
				Python <code>x+y</code>,
				<b>next</b> the computer
				sees...
				<b>next</b></p>

			<p>The above is for C Python implementation, and the
				instructions are called Bytecode. The above
				bytecode is for Python 3.6.</p>

			<p>The "2" on the first line means that the following
				instructions come from line two, until there is another line
				number given.  But since there are no other line numbers
				given, the Python interpreter assumes that all of the
				three instructions have something to do with line 2.</p>

			<p>The numbers 8, 10, and 12 are the instruction addresses, or
				really instruction offsets from where the function or module
				starts.  So being more precise about what is associated with
				line 2, the answer is instructions at offsets 8, 10, and
				12. In Python versions before 3.6, the instruction size for
				`LOAD_NAME` is 3 bytes instead of 2, so the offsets would be
				8, 11, and 14.</p>

			<p>And this (or a more obstruse binary-encoded version of that)
				is what the computer "sees" and runs.</p>

			<p>In this simple example, it looks like a single token in the
				source-code gets converted to a single line in the
				bytecode. However the order is a little bit different: the
				"add" comes at the end rather than in the middle.</p>

			<p>Compare that with... <b>next</b></p>

		<p class="fragment roll-in">but the computer sees:
			<pre class="fragment roll-in"><code>

		<h3>Spanish to English</h3>

		<p>A person says in Spanish: &#8220;mango fragante&#8221;</br>
		might translate in English to: &#8220;fragrant mango&#8221;</p>

		<aside class="notes">
			<p> 'mango fragante" vs "fragant mango".</p>

 			<p>This is pretty simple: you just switch the order of the words
				around and make some small spelling changes. That happens in
				bytecode translation too. Now consider: <b>next</b>
			</p>
			<p>Entiendo/I understand.<p>

			<p>Here, one Spanish word becomes two English words. That too
				happens in Python translation to bytecode. <b>next</b></p>

			<p>Finally consider... <b>next</b> templado</p>

			<p>In the last example, Which part of "templado" is "not hot" and
				which part is "and not cold"? The fact is that there is no
				simple English equivalent.</p>

			<p>This kind of thing <i>never</i> happens in Python translation to
				bytecode. <b>next</b></p>

			<p>And intentionally. Fortunately for us,
				the bytecode and the source code were designed to know about
				the same kinds of concepts.</p>

			<p>So how do we make sense of this? Let me suggest an answer by
				pointing out that you've probably already seen examples of
				this kind matching problem when you read a side-by-side
				translation:</p>
		</aside>

		<p class="fragment roll-in">A person says in Spanish:
		&#8220;Entiendo&#8221;</br> might translate in English to:
		&#8220;I understand&#8221;</p>

		<div class="fragment roll-in">
		<p class="fragment strike">A person says in Spanish:
			&#8220;templado&#8221;</br> might translate in English to:
			&#8220;not hot and not cold&#8221;</p></div>

		<h3>Side-by-side Translation</h3>


		<p>1: Whose woods these are I think I know.<br>
			 2: His house is in the village though</p>

		<p>1: A quién pertenece este bosque creo que sé<br>
			 2: Aunque su casa en el pueblo está</p>

		<aside class="notes">
			<p>You can assume that the first line of the English is roughly like the
				first line of the Spanish, and the second line of the English is like
				the second line of the Spanish. And possibly the words at the
				beginning or end of the sentence roughly go with words at the
				beginning of the corresponding translation. "His house" at the
				beginning of line two is almost the same position as "su casa." But
				not exactly, and sometimes the position doesn't match at all. For
				example, see the positions of "is" versus "está" on line two.
				Also "though" versus "Aunque".</p>

			<p>And this is sort of like what goes on when you get the error message
				that we saw above when it said the error was on line 2.</p>

			<p>So let's do a side-by-side translation in Python...</p>

		</aside>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Side-by-side Python translation</h3>

			<pre><code class="python">
  x = 1  # line 1
  y = 2  # line 2
		</code></pre>

		<pre><code>
  1: 0 LOAD_CONST  1
     2 STORE_NAME  x

  2: 4 LOAD_CONST  2
     6 STORE_NAME  y
    </code></pre>

		<aside class="notes">
			<p>Notice again that the order of the variable name and
				constants have been reversed as they were in the example
				with addition. The mathematical name for this kind of ordering
				is called "reverse polish notation". English adjectives are
				like that.</p>

			<p>Now that we have seen how this resembles a human-language
				translation problem, rather than a programmer-versus-computer
				problem, we can ask: how would we get more detail in the
				correspondences between the two translations?</p>

			<p>I'm sure many of you already know the answer: you break down the
				sentence into its grammar parts. So... <b>next</b></p>

			<p>And here is one translation of it in Spanish.</p>

			<p>At the top levels of the grammar they are the same: a
				sentence is a <i>subject</i> and a <i>predicate</i>.  In
				Spanish the subject is empty while in English it is
				required.  <b>back and forth</b>

				<p>I have simplified the example by removing grammar
				concepts like "noun phrase," "verb phrase," "noun," and so
				on. Adding these doesn't substantially change things other

		<h4>Debugging code created at runtime</h4>
		<aside class="notes"><p>This example is now probably the toughest
				for any debugger.. debugging code generated at runtime. In
				general, writing code that modifies itself at runtime, is
				frowned upon. For example there are security concerns. But I'm
				going to show you that in fact it happens a bit more than
				people admit. I'm going to do this using one of Python
				standard library routines, namedtuple.</p>

			<p>This class creates a tuple, where you can give names to the
				integer index elements. Here is a typical use...</p>

			<p>First I'll try debugging it with pdb. Where I really want to
			get to see is how creating the Point() class works, and how
			repr() is implemented. So I'll set a breakpoint.</p>

			<p>We see that in fact the Point class as generated somewhow at
			runtime. And so I can't see the source code to this with a
			"list" command. The position though seems to be line 8 of some
			unnamed string. That's helpful! (not). That then we go to line
			10 of some unnamed string. And then we return from that.</p>

			<p> The same thing seems to be true of the <i>__repr__</i>
				function.</p>

			<p>So let's try with the Python3 version of trepan called
				trepan3k. I'll although it is not clear here that trepan3k
				does detect a dark background and tries to make adjustment
				here.</p>

			<p>However I dont' think it tries hard enough. So I'll adjust to
				another pygments style.</p>

			<p>Note that I can do a "break followed by a continue" in one
			command by giving a number after continue. The @31 is the
			instruction offset when I am stopped. And now I can list lines
			of the funciton. The (1, 14) at the end just says line 1 of this
			file maps to line 14 in whatever source this originally came
			from. This si probably wrong since pdb said it was line 8. I
			don't know whihc one was right.
			</p>

			<p>But now that I can see what is in that function, I can start
				to query values in it. And I see in what part of that one line
				function I am about to run.  It looks like I've just am
				loading up the name of the function that I am about to
				call. Code to evaluate the parameters like _cls, x, or y,
				would come later.</p>.

			<p>I'll ask for help on <i>_tuple</i>. Ah it is the internal
			name for <code>tuple</code>. After a couple of steps I see that
			although I am on the same line, deparse tells me at this point I
			have evaluated everything on the line.</p>

			<p>And we can do the same thing when we step
			into <code>__repr__</code> in running <code>print</code></p>

			<p>Those of you how use Jetbrains, or some other debugger, I am
			curious how well those do in this kind of situation.</p>

		<h4>Debugging code when there is no no source</h4>
		<aside class="notes"><p>The last example I am going to show is
				debugging bytecode when there is no source code at all! Just
				the bytecode file. Reverse engineers: pay attention.</p>

			<p>There is a command-line program I wrote that will disassemble
			bytecode. It has a <code>--header</code> option to give meta
			information about a bytecode file. In particular, the version
			interpreter version and the magic number of the for the bytecode
			file. Alos it shows the file that was used to create it.
			Filename "exec" is pretty meaningless.</p>

			<p>Even though I don't have the source code, I can still run the
				program Python.</p>

			<p>But what if I try to debug it using the <code>pdb</code>
				module, I get gibberish. Python thinks the bytecode is
				text. I can't even issue a quit command or Ctrl-d to get out.
				I have to suspend and kill it.
			</p>

			<p>I've been running this inside Emacs, and I also I'm going to
			show an emacs package I wrote which interfaces not just to this
			debugger, trepan3k, but also to about a dozen others including
			pdb, and ipdb. The package is called realgud.</p>

			<p>The emacs package tracks the location for me. The green
				orange and brown arrows in the fringe indicate where the program
				is where has been. The realgud track all the places you've
				stopped.</p>

			Notice that in function <i>fib()</i> there are <i>two</i>
			recursive calls. And again deparse can show you which one was
			called.

			<p>And as you might expect in a debugger front-end, you highlight a
			region and have that evaluated. </p>

			<h3>There is more to do...</h3>
			<aside class="notes">
				<p>Through anology with human-language translation, I've shown
				a little bit of the challanges a decompiler faces, and also a
				this novel idea of how to get pretty precisely location
				information as a program runs.</p>

				<p>I also have this working for Perl, and I've looked
					at doing it in Emacs Lisp bytecode. The idea seems to be
					pretty general and can be applied to other languages. I hope
					others will help out in extending this to other
					languages.</p>
			</aside>

			Emacs Lisp:

			<pre><code class="lisp">
(/ a (/ b c)))
			</code></pre>


gives:

			<pre><code>
0	varref	  a
1	varref	  b
2	varref	  c
3	quo
4	quo
5	return
			</code></pre>

			<p>The wiki for the Python decompiler
				https://github.com/rocky/python-uncompyle6/wiki has a lot of
