    <p>Hey, everyone! Let's get started!</p>
    <p>About taking notes... When I was a student, a millennia ago, it
      was difficult for me to both <em>focus</em> on the
      topic, <em>and</em> take notes at the same time. If you are like
      that too, I'd prefer you <em>focus</em> on the <em>ideas</em>
      presented rather than taking <em>notes</em>.  The code that I
      will be talking about is available online. And I will make the
      notes available too.</p>

      <p>If, however, you are a natural note taker, and that helps you,
      carry on.
