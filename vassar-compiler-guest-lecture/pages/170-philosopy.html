      I started talking about the need and usefulness of
      compilers. The focus of this talk has been about how we can make
      a computer or machine "talk" communicate back to a human in a
      way that is easier for a human to understand. Personally, I
      spend a lot of time with computers and a lot of time trying to
      figure out and fix computer bugs, a big part of that
      is <em>why</em> a computer is not behaving in the way I would
      like it to.
    </p>

    <p>
      In closing, I'd like to reflect on this a little this. This part
      is a bit whimsical and philosophical.
    </p>

    <p>A computer is a human-made object. We decide how it should be
    built, and we design what instructions it should perform. But
    further, we also design programming languages or how <em>we</em>
    want to instruct or communicate with a computer to do our
    service. We design a translator from to bridge the gap from human
    thought to computer action. And yet, when there is a
    misunderstanding, we spend a great deal of our time and effort in
    trying to figure out what went wrong and why the computer is
    performing the way it is and how we can adjust this behavior by
    adjusting the instructions we give it.
    </p>

    <p>To me, this demonstrates a deeper problem of the difficultly in
      communication. Al Aho once remarked that he felt that in
      contrast to programming languages which we teach should use
      "context free" or unambiguous grammars, human language is
      possibly <em>inherently</em> ambiguous. Possibly because we <em>do
	not</em> want others to know <em>exactly</em> we mean.
    </p>

    <p>But that kind of introduction of confusion is not what is going
    on here.</p>

    <p>In the 1960's or so there was an effort to try to look for
    messages from extra-terrestrial beings, or send messages out into
    space so that they might be able to recognize us. From what I have
    encountered in my day-to-day experience in communicating with
    computers and trying to understand their communication back, I
    think the chances of success here are very slim.
    </p>

    <p>Still, I personally have spent a careers worth of interest
      and effort in trying to make computers communicate back to
      humans in a slightly better and more human-friendly way. I
      hope today I have shed a little light on what that endeavor
      looks like.
