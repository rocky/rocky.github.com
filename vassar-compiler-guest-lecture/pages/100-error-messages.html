  Programming tip: when giving an error message, try to provide what
  was <em>expected</em> as well as what was <em>given</em>.
</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Now that we have captured positions from the scanner and parser, we
  should use those in error messages.</p>

<p>
  I won't go over the code for this. You can find it on github. It is
  not that difficult or interesting.</p>

<p>But I will show a test run to show what we get when we now have
  position information available [PLAY]</p>

<p>I think the error messages could look a little nicer. I leave this
as an exercise for you to do this if you want to do so.
</p>

<p>But I do want to mention in writing a good error messages to try to
provide two pieces of information: what the
computer <em>expected</em>, and what the computer <em>got</em> instead.</p>
