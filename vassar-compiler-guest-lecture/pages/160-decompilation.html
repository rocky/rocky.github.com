<h1>Decompilation</h1>
<section>
  <div align="left">
    <p>A decompiler for language <em>L</em> is a <em>compiler</em> that
      translates the <em>output</em> language of a compiler (back) into a
      <em>input</em> language <em>L.</em>
    <p>There are <em>general-purpose</em> decompilers
      that don't care (or know much) about specific compilers and
      there are special purpose compilers that are custom to a
      particular compiler.</p>
    <p>I will talk about special-purpose compilers.</p>
  </div>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>The topic I have described here &mdash; how to keep track of
    position information &mdash; is not mentioned any of the compiler
    books shown before. So I guess it should not be surprising this is
    also not taught in compiler courses. And so I guess it is not
    surprising that compiler can sometimes be weak in providing
    support for debuggers.
    </p>


    <p>If you happen to come across a system, what can you do? Is
    there some tool that you can use so you don't have to understand the
    program in assembly code produced by a compiler?
    </p>

    <p>A decompiler can help here. It can translate the machine code
    back into source code. A decompiler can also help with the
    line-number granularity problem we saw before where you want to
    know more specifically where you are in a line.
    </p>

    <p>You can also think of a decompiler as trying to glue back
    together a clay pot that has been dropped and shattered into
    pieces. If the pot shattered into only a few pieces, it is not
    that difficult to reconstruct the pot to its original form.
    </p>

    <p>In the particular case of the 331 language compiler, this is
    the situation. When you look at the transformation rules that go
    from source code to AST to "expr" to assembly instructions, the
    transformations are pretty simple; sometimes they are
    one-to-one as we will soon see.

    <p>I am not going to say a lot about decompilers, or even
    special-purpose decompilers. To do this justice would take even
    longer than what I did for getting position information into
    executables, which I did not do justice to.
    </p>

    <p>But I would like to try to give <em>some</em> idea of that kind
      of thing that can be done in a special purpose decompiler for
      331.  Surprisingly, the situation found in 331 <em>does</em>
      happen somewhat frequently. There are insteresting and deeper
      reasons for this that may not be apparent.

    <p>
      Here is some of the 331 compiler code:
      <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN] 16.2 ⟶ 16.2
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      What is weird here is that an x86 "add" or "sub" instruction
      comes from only one place! For an x86 "add" it has to come from
      a 331-language "inc" function call. And for x86 "sub", it has to
      come from a 331-language "(dec)" function call.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now let us look at some code produced by 331...
      <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN] 16.2 ⟶ 16.3

      Here is a more involved piece of code that I had at one time
      considered showing. You can find it in the github repository.
      <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN line highlight] 16.3 ⟶ 16.3
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that has an add in there! So we know that the source code
      instruction for that comes from an "inc" instruction. We just
      need to figure out what the variable is that is getting
      incremented. And that appears in instructions before. So
      getting of the operand of "inc" needs to be pattern matched.
    </p>

    <p>
      That is great for "inc", but what about the other 331 language
      constructs? There are patterns in there for those as well, it's
      just harder to see.
      <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN] 16.3 ⟶ 16.3
      </div>
    </p>

    <p>
      This pattern comes <em>uniquely</em> from the Greater-Than
      comparison. You will find only one place in code generation
      where there is a move of the integer 1 into the AX register.  It
      might happen from some other code, but it <em>must</em> happen
      in a compare for this 331 compiler. Those other instructions
      that are highlighted are other parts of the DNA for comparison
      instructions.
    </p>

    <p>The greyed out instruction at 9 does not have to be a single
    instruction, just something that is getting a value from
    somewhere. So what we can do is write a grammar to parse the
    assembly instructions just like the source code!</p>
    <p>I have glossed over lots of details. Things are a little
    weirder and something just different. But the overall strategy
    where one tokenizes, and then parses, and abstracts and then
    constructs output from this internal representation can be done
    very much the same way it is done in a compiler.
