	A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, my first full-time
	computer job was in a mythical land called IBM T.J. Watson
	Research Center.

      <p>This mythical place is about 40 miles south of here and a
	little east, right off the Taconic Parkway.

      <p>One of the interesting things about this photo of the
         "lab" you see here, taken at dawn, is that you don't
         see a single person!  Anywhere!
      <p>
	The project I was hired for was to help develop a compiler for
	a newly-designed, fast-running CPU, called 801. This was IBM's
	&mdash; and possibly the world's &mdash; first
	reduced-instruction-set or "RISC" CPU. The research idea was
	reconsidering or re-<em>thinking</em> the division of labor
	between what should be done, or rather, what
	is <em>better</em> done, in a <em>compiler</em> versus what is
	better done in <em>hardware</em>. In contrast, the Intel x86
	instructions, are more "complex". What I mean by this, is that
	an x86 instruction, like <tt>mov</tt> which we will see later,
	is in fact level several "micro" or smaller instructions when
	run on the hardware chip. There is a layer of "microcode" in
	the between the machine code input and the chip hardware. This
	makes it possible for assembly-language and machine code
	instructions to look the same, independent of the level of
	sophistication of the chip underneath.</p>

      <p>But in a RISC CPU and in the 801 CPU in particular, there was
	no microcode layer. The low-level guts were exposed and
	available for the compiler to use, in strange and weird
	ways. In 1982, In contrast to earlier times, it was felt 1982
	that most people did not write in assembly code anymore, but
	rather wrote in high-level languages using
	a </em>compiler</em> to bridge the language gap.<p>

      <p>At any rate, a key for the success of this RISC CPU was having
	an "optimizing" compiler, or a compiler that produced
	fast-running code by taking advantage of this kind of lower,
	microcode-level, instruction set.</p>

      <p>By the way, when the project became successful, the IBM
	Marketing guys took over. They renamed the 801 CPU chip to
	[FIST] <b>POW-ER</b>. "801" was simply the building number
	that you see in this photo.</p>

      <p>Are there any marketing wizards in the audience? ... Any
	suggestions for a replacement name for the "331"
	language. ...Mighty Mouse maybe?

      Now fast forward 12 years of IBM tanking, and my switching from
      a research environment in suburban, upper-class Westchester, to
      the financial market jungle in New York City. I was a systems
      administrator.

      My job there was simply to keep the computers working
      reliably. (That's me on the bottom.) I was basically a high-tech
      boiler operator. But one who got paid 20% more than I did at IBM
      Research. And on top of that, I got a $20K bonus at the end of
      the year, because they liked me...

  <h1>My Story (conclusion)</h1>

  <h2>Law of the jungle:</h2>
  <p><em>If you can't prove that something is</em> not<em> your
      problem, then it</em> is <em>your problem.</em>

  <p class="fragment" style="font-family: Vollkorn, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 0.8em;">
    <em>And (with debuggers and tracing tools), they lived happily ever after...</em>
  </p>
  <aside class="notes">
    <font size="4.0em">
    <p>But the law of the jungle in this environment was: if you
      can't prove that something is <em>not</em> your problem, then
      it <em>is</em> your problem.

    <p>The financial programmers who wrote code in this environment
      weren't very good. Their interests were more focused on
      improving <em>salary</em> than improving program quality. So
      part of the system admnistrator's job was to <em>prove</em> that
      the code that we were tasked to run was leaking memory, or I/O
      resources, or just plain buggy. Invariably, this was the reason
      our computers were crashing. And if we could not
      be <em>demonstrate</em> a problem in the program, we'd have to
      get bigger, costlier, and faster computers with more memory
      ... <em>And</em> be able to reboot boxes faster...</p>
    <p>This led to hiring more people to reboot servers like
      myself. <em>Borat thumbs up</em>

    </p>

    <p>It is in this environment, that a debugger and better error
      information is <em>vital</em> when a program crashes.
    </p>

    <p>Another side note and I will stop. In the IBM Research compiler
      group, we needed a debugger for our compiler, and I was offered
      the opportunity write it. I declined.</p>

    <p>I recall thinking, why would I want to do that? Instead, I
      would rather write a paper on using alpha-beta search to perform
      some specific code optimization.
    </p>

    <p>I hope to influence a younger me in this audience that writing
    debuggers and tracing tools is worthwhile. And here, I will try to make
    it easier for you to write such debuggers and tools.
