<h1>Translation Concepts</h1>
<section>

  <p> If we have an instruction address, how can we figure out where we
    were in the source code?</p>

    <p>So with this background, let us start to understanding how we
      can enable a compiler to give source-code location information
      when there is a crash in the program, or when you are using a
      debugger to debug a 331 program.
    </p>

    <p>Here is some x86 code produced by a 331 compiler. The position
    we are at is marked on the left by an arrow. The address ends in
    "55185". It is a <code>mov</code> instruction.</p>

    <p>By the way, this instruction is probably several <em>micro</em>
    instructions in the underlying x86 CPU chip. On a RISC
    archecture like POWER (or 801), the operand "subtract 8 from the SP
    register address" (<code>-0x8(%rsp)</code>) would be a separate
    instruction.
    </p>

    <p>But at any rate, the 331 source code that covers this assembly
      is listed below. This is the code that starts with a call to the
      built-in function <code>let</code>.
    </p>

    <p>How do we match up the assembly code with the source code?</p>

    <p>Actually, you have probably encountered this kind of situation
    before outside of computers. This kind of thing happens in reading
    translated poetry...

  <h2>Side-by-side Scots-American Translation</h2>


  <p align=left>1: Fair fa' your honest, sonsie face,<br>
    2: Great chieftain o the puddin'-race!</p>

  <p align=left>1: Good luck to you and your honest, plump face,<br>
    2: Great chieftain of the sausage race!</p>

<aside class="notes">
  <font size="4.0em">
  <p>Note. This example comes from a talk I gave in Glasgow,
    Scotland. That is why I used Scots.
  </p>

  <p>You can assume that the entire first line, at the top in Scots,
    is roughly like the first line of the English below. And the
    second line of the Scots on top is like the second line of the
    American English, below.
  </p>

  <p>Since Scots and American English are so close, you can do a
    word-for-word translation ... for the most part. We will come back
    to this.</p>

  <p>In this particular example, words at the beginning of Scots
    sentences match words at the beginning of the corresponding English lines.
    Similarly, words the <em>end</em> of Scots lines match the words
    at the end of the corresponding English lines.</p>

  <p>I, and probably others, have used this kind beginning/end
     heuristic to help decipher compiled assembly code. But there are
     a couple of caveats here, which I will describe next...

  <h2>Spanish vs. English Ordering</h2>

  <p align="left">
    A person says in Spanish: &#8220;mango fragante&#8221;</br>
    might translate in English to: &#8220;fragrant mango&#8221;</p>

  <aside class="notes">
    <font size="3.0em">
    <p>In this slide, we switch to Spanish for reasons that will soon
      become clear. This slide comes from a talk given in Medellín,
      Columbia.</p>

    <p>In Spanish: "mango fragante" might translate in English to:
      "fragrant mango".</p>

    <p>
      What we see here is a switch in <em>word</em> order. And this kind of
      thing happens when source code gets translated to assembly language.
    </p>

    <p>
      In English and Romance languages, we think of the nouns as
      main structural units, and adjectives as a <em>modifier</em>
      or <em>parameter</em> attached to the noun. So think of "mango"
      as analogous to a 331-language <em>function</em> name or an x86
      assembly
      <em>instruction</em> name. And think of "fragrant" or "fragrante"
      as a parameter <em>value</em> or as an instruction <em>operand</em>.
    </p>

    <p> Given this, what mathematical expression order does <em>Spanish</em>
      follow &mdash; where the noun comes <em>first</em>, and the
      adjective or adjectives follow? ... Anyone? ...
      Is it infix, prefix, or postfix order (noun first, then adjective)?
    </p>

    <p>Great - prefix order! Now what operation order does <em>English</em>
      follow, where the noun comes <em>last</em>, and all adjectives
      precede the noun? .... Right... postfix order.
    </p>

    <p>
      In sum, what we see here is that ordering changes based on a
      fundamental property of the language that we are using.  Keep
      this in mind. We will see this come up later.

    <p>
      Now let us consider this example ...
      <div style="color: blue; background-color: LightYellow">
	[DOWN] 6.3 ⟶ 6.4

  <h2>Implied words</h2>

  <p align="left">A person says in Spanish:
    &#8220;Entiendo&#8221;</br> might translate in English to:
    &#8220;I understand&#8221;</p>

  <p align="left" class="fragment roll-in">&#8220;Far Fa&apos;&#8221; ⟶ &#8220;Good luck (to you and)&#8221;
  </p>

  <aside class="notes">
    <font size="5.0em">
    <p>"Entiendo" might be translated in English to "I understand".<p>

    <p>Here, one Spanish word becomes <em>more than one</em> English
      word. When we compile 331 functions to x86 assembly language, we
      also sometimes see <em>several</em> x86 instructions for
      a <em>single</em> 331 construct. In sense, this shows that the
      331 language is a higher-level language than x86 assembly.

      <div style="color: blue; background-color: LightYellow">
	[DOWN] 6.1 ⟶ 6.2
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall earlier in Scots we had &#8220;Far fa&apos;&#8221; which,
      in <em>that</em> particular context, got translated as
      &#8220;Good luck to you and&#8221; &mdash; the "to you and" is
      somehow implied in the Scots but needs to be added in
      English. Does this mean that Scots is ao higher level language?

  <h2>Mismatched Concepts</h2>

  <div>
    <p align="left" class="fragment strike">A person says in Spanish:
      &#8220;templado&#8221;</br> might translate in English to:
      &#8220;not hot and not cold&#8221;</p></div>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Finally, consider the Spanish word <em>templado</em>...
    </p>

    <p>Which part of "templado" is "not hot" and which part is "and
      not cold"? The concepts are mismatched, so there is no simple
      English equivalent. As we say in Yiddish: Oy vey!</p>

    <p>This kind of thing tends not happen in translating 331 to x86
    assembly except in prologue code.
      <div style="color: blue; background-color: LightYellow">
	[DOWN] 6.6 ⟶ 6.7
      </div>
    </p>

    <p>And we expect this because x86 and bytecode and the source code
      were designed to generally speak the same kinds of concepts.
      <div style="color: blue; background-color: LightYellow">
	[NEXT] 6.7 ⟶ 7.1
