    To recap, we have now tracked passing position information from
    the scanner and parser through to the object deck. The last step
    is to run a linker with the 331 and some boilerplate main
    code. This is done using "gcc" which a command that not only
    compiles a C main program but also links in the object code that
    comes 331.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here, I want to take a step back and go through the entire 331
    compilation process. In this we will fill in the gaps from last
    slide when working with the object decks.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		  LightYellow">
      [DOWN for line highlight] 13.1 ⟶ 13.1
    </div>
  </p>

  <p>
    We kick everything off using GNU Make:
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN for line highlight] 13.1 ⟶ 13.1
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    As before the first step is to create a GNU assembler file from
    the 331 source text.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN for line highlight] 13.1 ⟶ 13.1
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, we create a custom main program in C as a wrapper to our 331
    code. Before, we used the same C program independent of the 331
    program that was getting compiled. Here, would like to show the
    source code associated with our position, and we can only do that
    if the main program refers to this file in some way. What we do is
    add C "#include" for the 331 program.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN for line highlight] 13.1 ⟶ 13.1
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    We can't really include the 331 program as is. So instead we will
    wrap the code a c comment. And then we can include that
    substituted file instead. That is why we have the ".h" appended.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN for line highlight] 13.1 ⟶ 13.1
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    So now we need to make the file "inc.331.h"
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN for line highlight] 13.1 ⟶ 13.1
    </div>
    And this is calls a bash script <tt>make-debug-include.sh</tt> to
    do this
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN for line highlight] 13.1 ⟶ 13.1
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
  And now we have our 331 code wrapped in a C comment. So what was on
  line 1 is now on line 2.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, we are ready for the last step.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN for line highlight] 13.1 ⟶ 13.1
      [NEXT] 13.1 ⟶ 13.2
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    Here we run "gcc" to both compile a C file and link in our
    331-derived object dec. The "-z noexecstack" switch is to silence
    a warning about about how we are linking everything together which
    apparently is not totally Kosher. The line "rm" line after "gcc"
    gcc is running on its own and I don't know why.</p>
  <p>
    And <em>FINALLY</em> we can run the code. When we do, we affirm
    that 1 plus 1 is still two in the 331 language.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN for line highlight] 13.1 ⟶ 13.1
      [NEXT] 13.1 ⟶ 13.2
    </div>
