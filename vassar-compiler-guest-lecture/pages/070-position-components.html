  <h1>Positions: Location, Location, Location...</h1>
  <br/>

  <div align="left" class="fragment">
  <p>In everyday life, a location (which I will call a <em>position</em>) is a street address:</p>
  <p>
  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Apartment 4F</br>
  Washington D.C. 20000</br>
  </p>
  </div>

  <br/>

  <div align="left">
  <p class="fragment">A <em>position</em> can be broken down into
  several parts, but I will focus on just two parts:
    <ol align="left">
      <li class="fragment">&nbsp; A <em>container</em></li>
      <li class="fragment">&nbsp; A <em>location</em> inside the container</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  </div>

    <p>
      We now have a <em>general</em> idea of what we need to do: associate
      specific spots in the assembly code with specific spots the
      source code.
    </p>

    <p align="left">But what is a position?
      <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		  LightYellow">
	[DOWN fragment reveal] 7.1 ⟶ 7.1
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>It is analogous to a street address.
       A position can be broken into down parts, ...
      <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		  LightYellow">
	[DOWN fragment reveal] 7.1 ⟶ 7.1
      </div>
      but I will focus on two top-level pieces...
      <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		  LightYellow">
	[DOWN fragment reveal] 7.1 ⟶ 7.1
      </div>
    </p>

    <p>The first piece of information I will call
      a <em>container</em>. In the example above, it is
      the <em>bottom-most</em> portion. "Washington D.C. Twenty Thousand".
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common example of a container for a <em>program</em> is
      a <em>file name</em>. But we will go into this in more detail soon,
      and I'll ask for thoughts on <em>other</em> kinds of containers for
      programs. So think about this, and how they can arise.
      <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
	[DOWN fragment reveal] 7.1 ⟶ 7.1
      </div>
    </p>

    <p>The second group of information inside a position, is probably
         the thing that most people naturally think of...
      <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		  LightYellow">
	[DOWN fragment reveal] 7.1 ⟶ 7.1
      </div>
      a place or <em>location</em> inside a container.
    </p>
    <p>So now let's break down what a container is...
      <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		  LightYellow">
	[NEXT] 7.1 ⟶ 8.1
      </div>

  <h1>What are Containers?</h1>

  <p align="left">Some possibilities:
    <ul>
      <li>a file in a file system,</li>
      <li class="fragment">a stream from a socket or piped into a compiler,</li>
      <li class="fragment">a piece of an "archive"-format file:
          Java classfile <tt>jar</tt>, Python <tt>wheel</tt>
          (<tt>zip</tt>), or machine-code library, etc.,</li>
      <li class="fragment">a string or AST data-structure created inside a program
          at runtime, e.g. HTML templating system for Web framework, an
          AI auto-learning system</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <aside class="notes">
    <font size="3.em">
    <p>Program source code comes from <em>somewhere</em>. It is useful
    for ta programmer or an IDE to know <em>where</em> it came
    from. So what are some possibilities? As I said before, a file in
    the file system is the most common possibility. Any other
    suggestions? [Solicit ideas...]
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN fragment reveal] 7.2 ⟶ 7.2
    </div>
    </p>

    <p>a stream from a socket which might happen in remote
      execution. Or a stream piped into a compiler
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN fragment reveal] 7.2 ⟶ 7.2
    </div>
    </p>

    <p>a piece of an archive-format file. In Java this is called "class file" or
      <tt>jar</tt> file and is encoded like a <tt>zip</tt>
      file. Python <tt>wheels</tt> are zip files too.  Machine code
      libraries are collections too, they are in a format called
      "archive" and are built using the command Aee R in Linux. Note:
      the word, "jar" used by Java the word is a modification of (Aee
  v      R) in machine code. So "jar" stands for "Java archive" and you
      may have heard about a "tar" file which stands for "tape
      archive" even though nowadays physical tapes are no longer used.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		LightYellow">
      [DOWN fragment reveal] 7.2 ⟶ 7.2
    </div>
    </p>

    <p>Another possibility is a string or AST data-structure created
      inside a program at runtime, for example an HTML templating
      system for Web framework, or AI self-modying code in an
      auto-learning system.
    </p>

    <p>In the 331 language, programs come from a file stored in your
      file system. So we won't dwell further on the containers. But
         note that while locations inside a container change bit, the
      container itself doesn't change that often. This is useful to
      keep in mind when designing a data structure for positions.
    </p>

    <p>In the 331 language, there is only one container. The standard
    runtime data format which we will talk about later, provides for
    file path. It also understands that file paths are contained inside a
    directory.
