    <p>Here, we have the code to pass location information into the list
      of instructions generated for <tt>inc</tt> and <tt>dec</tt>.

      The changes here, like other places are very simple, we are
      passing <em>down</em> position information from parent node in the
      AST, and using passing that into location "pseudo instruction".
      The routine to create the location pseudo instruction is called
      "Loc". we have to decide here is <em>where</em> before which
      instruction we want to mark the position in the instruction
      stream. I think the right place is just before the x86 ADD
      instruction if we have "inc", or before the x86 SUB
      instruction if we have "dec".

    <p>
      Here is the definition of Loc:

    <p>Here we have the changed code AST to instruction code for <tt>inc</tt> and <tt>dec</tt>.
      <div style="color: blue; background-color:

      The changes here, like other places are very simple, we are
      passing <em>down</em> position information from parent node in the
      AST, and using that create a location "pseudo instruction" at the
      right place in the instruction stream.  The routine to create the
      location pseudo instruction is call "Loc". And we place this just
      before the instruction for add (if we have "inc") or subtract (if we have "dec").

      Here is the definition of Loc:
      <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		  LightYellow">
	[DOWN line highlight] 11.1 ⟶ 11.1
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <tt>.loc</tt> is a pseudo instruction defined in the GNU
      assembler.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think the code here is pretty straight-forward. We do have to
      add one since the sexplib library starts counting columns from
      0, while non-computer people say that we start on column 1. The
      reason we add one to the <em>line</em> number, will described
      later.
