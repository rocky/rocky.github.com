      <p>Now that we have assembly code, we will go through the process of
      getting position information into an executable.
    </p>
    <p>
    First, we get move into the "example" directory:
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		  LightYellow"> [DOWN for line highlight] 12.1 ⟶ 12.1
    </div>
    and then we run the compiler and save its output to an assembly
    file, "inc.s". We display that here.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		  LightYellow"> [DOWN for line highlight] 12.1 ⟶ 12.1
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>I have not shown how that ".file" pseudo instruction got in
      there, nor why it has the name "inc.331.h" instead of
      "inc.331". I will explain that later. Just note here that we are
      defining short name "1" for the file "inc.331.h". A common theme
      you will find when working with debug tables is that there is an
      effort to compact things; Even assuming 64-bits per integer, an
      integer is usually smaller than a file path name. An in fact
      it <em>is</em> just barely shorter than the 9-character string
      that we have here.
    </p>

    <p>In the ".loc" lines below, you will see this file number "1"
      mentioned right after ".loc".
    </p>
    <p>
    We have two ".loc" lines. The first ".loc" is for column 6 of the
    program, and the second ".loc" is for column 2 of the program.  The
    column number given as the last number of the three numbers in a
    ".loc" line. The middle number, is a line number. Here, it is line
    2, even though in our original source file this was line one.
    Inside "inc.331.h", the line number has been shifted to line 2.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		  LightYellow"> [DOWN for line highlight] 12.1 ⟶ 12.1
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>
    Now that we have our assembly code, the next and penultimate step
    of the compile process is to create a an object file. This is done
    using the GNU assembler: Aee S. In previous code the assembler was
    getting called via the GNU cc toolchain command <tt>gcc</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the Aee S command, the <tt>-g</tt> flag tells the assembler
    that to pass through debug information found in the file. By
    default, again, <em>partly</em> for compactness, it won't pass
    through debug information.
    <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		  LightYellow"> [DOWN for line highlight] 12.1 ⟶ 12.1
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>
    To show that the debug information got into the object deck, we
    use the "objdump" command. I am using "grep" to pick out the
    portion of interest. The "-g" flag indicates that we are
    interested in seeing debug information. The debug information
    contains position information from ".loc" pseudo instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
    The object format changes based on the Operating System you are
    running. On Linux the object format used is called ELF. On
    Microsoft Windows, it is called cough, spelled "C-O-F-F" is
    used. The F at the end seems popular and usually stands for
    "format". On MacOS, it is something different that doesn't end in
    F.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though the object format varies per Operating System, the
      debug portion does <em>not</em>. The common format across most
      operating systems nowadays is called DWARF. Again this ends in
      "F". Dr. Brian Russell at Bell Labs who designed and implemented
      this format gave it the name "DWARF" to go with the "ELF"
      motif. There is some backronym though that I cannot remember,
      but the "D" at the beginning stands for "Debugger".
    </p>
    <p>I reason I mention that this format is called DWARF, is so that
      you can look up the exact details of what is on lines 16-22 if
      you want.  These lines are showing the steps that a specialized
      DWARF interpreter is running. And the reason it is running
      running this interpreter, again, is in order to compact the debug
      information stored in the object deck.
      <div style="color: blue; background-color:
		  LightYellow"> [DOWN for line highlight] 12.1 ⟶ 12.1
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      However the parts of the trace output that are relevant to us
      are these lines which just affirm that there is a mark for column
      6 at address 0, and a mark for column 2 at address 7.
