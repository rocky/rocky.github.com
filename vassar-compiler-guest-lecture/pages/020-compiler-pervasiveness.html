      When I was getting my computer-science degree in college, there
      were a number courses on topics that <em>did</em> not have much
      bearing on my current day-to-day use of computers. However, I
      use a <em>compiler</em> virtually every day I program.
      </p>

      <p><em>This</em> screen shot shows a snapsot of the user
      processes on my laptop in building Python 3.13. New releases
      come out 3 or 4 times a year.</p>

    <p>The stuff in bright green on the right,
      [Right-CTRL Left click to Zoom],

      These are currently <em>running</em> process taking up CPU
      time. You might not be able to read the process names, but most
      of those green processes say "cc1", which is early phase of
      running the "gcc" compiler toolchain.  You'll also see one
      assembler process "Ayee-Ess" which is the GNU x86 assembler,
      running a later phase of gcc tool chain.

      Even when I am not fully compiling code, but just looking at my
      code or someone else's code, there is a compiler running in the
      background that is gathering bits of information which is either
      presented on screen, or <em>might</em> be at the click of a
      button.

    <p>The code in this slide is part of the modified 331 compiler
    that I will be talking about later.

      And even if you are not a computer scientist or programmer, when
      you browse an e-comerce site that is under constant development,
      like Amazon.com, compilers are continually getting run in the
      process of testing and deploying code to web-sites.
    </p>
    <p>
      And even if the website did not run a <em>compiler</em> to build
      and test the site, the <em>browser</em> on your laptop or mobile
      phone may have a compiler running that is turning Javascript
      into WASM (Web assembly). It does this to make your browser work
      faster.
