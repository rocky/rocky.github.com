    <ul>
      <li>[0:10] First, I get a list of positions from the x86 assembly file.</li>
      <li>Next, I run "lldb". I use this instead of gdb because it can stop at column numbers. [PLAY]</li>
      <li>[0:31] Notice I have stopped at "our_code_starts_here" which
	in objdump was addresss 0. and "our_code_starts_here+7" which
	was listed as address 7. The actual addresses at runtime are different. [PLAY TO END</li>
      <li>I am now going to run the code twice and you will see it pick show the positions.</li>
      <li>At the end I got the value of AX which is 1 to show that I
	was stopped before the "Inc".  Then I stepped a single
	assembly instruction and we see the register now has 2. So we
	indeed stopped at the right place.
    </ul>
    <p>This concludes what I have to say about getting position
      information into the compiler</p>
    <p>Similar work needs to be tone to associate stack addresses and
    registers at particular points in time with source text variable
    names and the kinds of types they hold.
