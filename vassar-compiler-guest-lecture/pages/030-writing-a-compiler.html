      So, I understand in this course you've all been developing a
      compiler for the 331 language. And if there are people from past
      semesters, you already <em>have</em> developed a compiler.
    </p>

    <p>Perhaps in the future, 331 will take the world by storm and
      become <em>the</em> next programming language. Or, maybe using
      the information from this or other compiler courses, some of you
      will design and develop your own new and novel programming
      language. Personally, I think that would be <em>awesome</em>!
    </p>

    <p>
      But somewhere along that journey, someone, such as myself, may
      write code in your language. And therefore, I may use your
      compiler and run the code. And it may happen that in doing
      that, the code will crash.

  <p>So what happens when users encounter errors and bugs?</p>

      <p>So what happens when a user encounters an error?  The error
	might be a bug in the compiler; or it might be a programmer
	mistake, especially if it is someone like myself.
