<p>I make a lot of mistakes, and always have. I even make mistakes in
finding my mistakes.</p>

<p>So when I do, I'd like to know exactly where I am at. Computers
generally excel at giving detailed information involving lots of
calculation. But in this one area, just about all of the programming
languages I use could do better at giving more precise and useful
information. Generally there is just a line number possibly with the
source text describing a location, and sometimes that's good
enough. But sometimes it isn't...</p>

<h3>Line numbers are not good enough</h3>

<pre><code class="python">
x = prev[prev[0]]                      # which prev ?
y = a / b / c                          # which divide is invalid?
[x[0] for i in d[j] if got[i] == e[i]] # lots going on here
exec("a=x; b=y")                       # code created at runtime
</code></pre>

<aside class="notes">
<p>If I get an error in subscripting "prev", which "prev" access are we talking about?  If I get a divide error in the next line, which divide are we talking about?</p>

<p>Here, I'll show my hack for Python which can disambiguate.</p>

<h3>Python 3.6 bytecode</h3>

<pre><code class="python">
prev[prev[0]]
</code></pre>


compiles to:

<pre><code>
  2       10 LOAD_NAME           0          prev
          12 LOAD_NAME           0          prev
          14 LOAD_CONST          1          0
          16 BINARY_SUBSCR       None
          18 BINARY_SUBSCR       None
          20 POP_TOP             None
</code></pre>


<aside class="notes">
<p>But first a little background. When you run a program, the computer
always has to know which instruction to run next. In Python, the
location of the instruction (which is different from the source code
line) is called an "offset."</p>

<p>Here is the relevant part of a Python 3.6 disassembly of the above
code</p>

<p>You don't really need to know in detail what the above means. But
each line is an "instruction" and the numbers that start at 10 and run
to 20 are the instruction offsets. And you'll see a couple of
instructions repeated, like <code>LOAD_NAME</code>
or <code>BINARY_SUBCR</code>, but with different offsets. In Python
2.7 everything looks the same except for those offset numbers.<p>

<p>In the assembly listing, the "2" means that any instruction from
offset 10 to 20 comes from something on line 2. And you'll see that
this is vague, because <em>any</em> of the instructions above are on
line 2 and we might hit an error on any one of those instructions.</p>

<p>So now let me describe a little bit about parsing and
compiling. This is what transformed the first Python text into the
representation of the second text shown above. Furthermore a very
similar process can be used to transform the last text back into the
first as well - and that's my hack!</p>

<p>So let me describe how parsing works.</p>

<p>When I talk you hear sounds. Unconsciously you break those sounds into
segments, and then still unconsciously you combine those until you
recognize words and sentences. And only starting at one of these
higher levels do you start to understand what I am saying. If you were
to read the text for this talk, the process is similar, although the
lowest-level recognition is letters rather than sounds. You read
letters and then form them into words, and then into sentences.</p>

<p>The point is that sounds and letters aren't the same - this is the
reason for the notorious problems of English spelling - but the
higher-level combinations do wind up in pretty much the same place.</p>.

<p>And how the corresponding idea applies to byte-code instructions</p>
</aside>
</section>
<aside class="notes">
Compilers do something similar. A compiler takes a flow of characters
and transforms that into a flow of tokens. A token is something like
"identifier with value prev" or "binary operator of the divide
kind". And then from that a compiler forms a larger conceptual unit
called a Python "expression" and from that it creates the Python
"statement," and then the "function" or "module," and so on.</p>

<p>The reverse process done by a "decompiler" works similarly. A
decompiler is still a compiler of sorts. But here we start with
"instructions" rather than characters. From that we eventually we get
an "expression". From there, understanding the rest is the same as the
compiler. This is similar to how the process works for verbal versus
written communication.</p>

<h3>Bytecode assembly Parse</h3>

<p>Again, you don't have to understand in detail what this means, my hack
program does that. But what you should notice is that embedded in the
above are exactly the instructions that we saw before. However there
are additional lines and nesting which indicates how the instructions
	are grouped together, similar to my sentence parse.</p>
</p>

<p>As before, we see that both <code>LOAD_NAME</code>
and <code>BINARY_SUBSCR</code> appear twice. But note now that they
are at different indentation levels which represents which structure
they are part of. Inside my debugger which sorts this out what you see
simply is:
</aside>


<pre><code>2 10 LOAD_NAME "prev"
  12 LOAD_NAME "prev"
  14 LOAD_CONST 0
  16 BINARY_SUBSCR
  18 BINARY_SUBSCR
</code></pre>

when parsed becomes:

<pre><code>    0. expr
       binary_subscr (3)
         0. expr
            L.   2      10  LOAD_NAME 'prev'
         1. expr
            binary_subscr (3)
            0. expr
                        12  LOAD_NAME 'prev'
            1. expr
                        14  LOAD_CONST 0  ''
            2.          16  BINARY_SUBSCR
         2.          18  BINARY_SUBSCR
...

<h3>Displaying the results</h3>

At offset 16:
<pre><code>instruction      16  BINARY_SUBSCR

prev[prev[0]]
     -------
</code></pre>
At offset 18:

<pre><code>instruction      18  BINARY_SUBSCR

prev[prev[0]]
-------------
</code></pre>

<p>This comes from the tree structure in the parse.

In sum, in very broad terms I've shown how my program can describe
with great detail where a Python program is when it hits an error. I
have also done this for Perl as well.

<p>It may not be obvious, but to do the above requires a great deal of
effort and work. I've glossed over many, many details.</p>

<p>The reason I give this talk is to introduce this concept and hope
you tell your friends. This really isn't the end of the story but just
the beginning. I have done this for both Perl and Python but there are
many other languages that this technique can be applied to, and I hope
ill be.</p>

<p>
Perhaps some of you or your friends will carry on and help out fellow
programmers who have the same problem as I do when we make mistakes.

<h3>There is more to do...</h3>

Emacs Lisp:

<pre><code class="lisp">
(/ a (/ b c)))
</code></pre>


gives:

<pre><code>
0	varref	  a
1	varref	  b
2	varref	  c
3	quo
4	quo
5	return
</code></pre>

      2. bin_op
          4  QUO
    1. opt_discard

```

Note the similarity in parse structure with previous examples
