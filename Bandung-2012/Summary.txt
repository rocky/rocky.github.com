I'll talk about when a debugger might be useful and show out it is similar and different from rails/console or irb. Then I will give some features of ruby-debug that are often overlooked. I may show a little of the features my rewrite of ruby-debug (trepanning and rb8-trepanning). Bring your questions and laptops!
